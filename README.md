# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project consists of a website with a total of 5 html pages and 2 stylesheets(1 sass compiled). 

The websites main idea is to showcase 3 pairs of shoes everyweek for the user to compare prices, find out about shoes they didn't previously knew
and vote for their favorite of the week. If you like the shoe you see, you can see more details about its model provided by the website.

The index file contains the html of the main page, where you can find and ordered list with images of the 3 shoes showcased, hyperlinks to the details of the shoes and to the comparison page, and the favorite shoe section at the bottom which are buttons styled by a bootstrap component. This html page is also media responsive and it turns its background color to blue when the display is less than 600px. 

Htmls shoe 1, 2 and 3, are accessed from the main page and display a table with details about the shoe you selected.

The comparison html uses a 2 column grid bootstrap system and it displays the comparison of prices for the 3 shoes of the week.  This html is styled with a scss compiled stylesheet which takes advantage of inheritance, variables, and nesting.
